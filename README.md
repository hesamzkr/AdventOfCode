# How to run

## [2021-2023]

- Run a specific day with `cargo run [year] [day]` .

- If year isn't specified the latest year will be assumed.

- Run all solutions so far with `all` as `[day]`.

- Run with just `cargo run` to read year and day from console.

## [2020]

Run each day by running the executable file of the day.
